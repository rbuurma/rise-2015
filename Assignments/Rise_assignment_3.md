# Indexing *Pamela* (Exercise 3)

While we have read a good long chunk of *Pamela*, we don't have time to read all of the first two volumes, let alone to read volumes 3 and 4 about Pamela's life in (*spoiler alert*) "Her Exalted Condition." We need a shortcut - some plot summaries, maybe an index of the high points and important parts of the novel. Even the part we read can be difficult to remember in the detail we might need for a particular purpose - paper writing, for example, or impressing new acquaintances at cocktails parties with apposite Richardson quotations. (Note: don't actually try that second one.)

Eighteenth-century readers possessed a number of forms and technologies for solving this problem. In the 1742 octavo edition of all four volumes of *Pamela*, Richardson included a detailed table of contents. It had uses for different kinds of readers and non-readers of that novel. It would "serve to revive the Memory of the principle Matters in the Minds of those who have read them";  it gives "an easy and clear View" of the novels' contents to those who have not read them "nor perhaps have Leisure to peruse them" (note the reference to the politics of leisure and work as discussed in class).  At the same time, Richardson explained, the table of contents functions as "a copious INDEX to direct the Reader where to find the most material passages."

Later, at the urging of his friend, Samuel Johnson, Richardson would go on to publish *A collection of the moral and instructive sentiments, maxims, cautions, and reflexions, contained in the histories of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison* (1755). Johnson had requested that Richardson add a topical "index" to *Clarissa*, his second major novel, in order to help "the busy, the aged, and the studious" locate instructional passages. Richardson eventually compiled such indexes to each of his major novels and published them as a separate volume, including volume and page number citations to refer the reader back to the novels. The *Collection* abandoned plot summary in favor of summarizing the teachings of *Pamela* and the other novels.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

In this exercise, we will take a look at Richardson's various indexes to *Pamela* and construct some new (and more temporary) indexes (indices?) of our own.

### Richardson's Indexes to *Pamela*

First, take a look at the [1742 Table of Contents](/Assignment_materials/Pamela_1742_Table_of_Contents.pdf). What kind of information about the novels (*Pamela* and *Pamela in Her Exalted Condition*) does it offer you? How is it organized? What is the narrative voice like? What kinds of words are repeated, what kinds of events are described? Does this information point towards any new interpretations of *Pamela*, large or small?

Next, skim through the section of the 1755 [*Collection*](https://books.google.com/books?id=e94NAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) that deals with *Pamela* and *Pamela in Her Exalted Condition*. (You can also find a plain-text version [here](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecco;idno=004835423.0001.000).) How does the *Collection* compare to the 1742 index?

### Machine-Indexing *Pamela*

The second part of of this exercise ask you to use the collection of text analysis tools in Voyant to make your own indexes to *Pamela*.

Try to set aside a few hours for this assignment. You want to give yourself permission mess around with Voyant in an open-ended, non-goal-oriented way while still making sure you find something interesting to write about. *Consider taking some screen shots along the way to illustrate your write-up.*

For additional instructions, here is the [Voyant documentation](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/); it includes links to additional tools you can use in Voyant (milage may vary) and tutorials.

#### Step 1

Go to http://voyant-tools.org/ and upload the clean copy of *Pamela* you can find on Github and in our Dropbox. (Note that the plain-text copy of *Pamela* we are using is drawn from [this](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/6124/pg6124.txt) Project Gutenberg text. Take a quick look at it - what edition does it seem to be based on? We will tackle questions to do with text preparation and cleaning in a future assignment, but it's worth giving them a thought now.)

When you have uploaded, press "reveal" and a new window will open. Note that if you mouse over the right-hand corner of the blue bar at the top of the page and click the arrow icon, it will give you a url that will save this state of Voyant for you to return to.

#### Step 2

Look first at the “word cloud” generated by Voyant (in the upper-left hand corner of the screen). This gives you a visual representation of word frequency - larger words are used more often. Maximize the word cloud window by dragging the bottom right-hand corner of the window down and to the right. (You should be able to do this with any of the windows in Voyant.)

Look at the visualization of frequent words. Do some of them seem interesting? Make a note of which. How do these compare to the words you noticed appearing most frequency in Richardson's *Pamela* indexes?

Do many of these words seem not that interesting? Mouse over the right-hand side of the gray bar at the top of the word cloud window and click the icon that looks like an on/off switch. "Stopwords" should already be set to "Auto-detect". Try changing the setting to "None." Refresh the word cloud. What changed? What did the stopword list do when it was turned on?

Turn stopwords back on. Are there still some words you would like to remove to make room for potentially more interesting words? Click the button again, and next to Stopwords, choose "Edit list." Add some words that you would like to remove, and save your list. What do you see now? (Note: we will talk more about the poetics and practices of stop word lists in the future, but it is worth giving them a thought now.) Note that if you select "apply stop words globally" they will apply to all of the windows; if not they will apply only to the window in which you are working.

#### Step 3

For another way to explore word use in the novel, turn to the "Reader" window and find a section of *Pamela* that is interesting to you. Notice that when you float over the words it tells you the frequency with which the word is used. When you click on these words, you’ll see on the right that you can jump to the various places in the novel where the word is used. Think about how Richardson uses one or two example words of your choice in other places. Does he use the word in the same way? Differently?

#### Step 4

Glance through the list of words in the bottom-left hand corner of the screen-—this is a list of words ranked by the number of times they are used in *Pamela*.  Do you recognize any patterns in these words? Are there any commonly used words that are surprising to you? Anything you would expect to be there that is missing?

Try selecting a word, and see its frequency over time appear in the upper-right-hand "word trends" window. Play around until you figure out how to compare multiple words; then try to come up with some interesting single words and interesting comparisons.

For example, I might use the search box in the "Document Terms" window to search for the word "know." Note that typing in "know*" should pull up "know," "knows," "known," "knowing," and "knowledge." (Click the question mark icon in the search box to see a full list of supported search syntax.) Then I try to think of a word or words I want to graph against "know" - "feel" suggests itself to me, but I find no occurrences! I set this negative finding aside to investigate later, and move on to compare some more trends.

#### Step 5

This portion of the assignment should help us think about the relationship between *Pamela*, various eighteenth-century responses to *Pamela*, and Richardson's other work. Download this [zip file](/Assignment_materials/Pamela_corpus.zip), which includes plain text versions of *Pamela*, *Shamela*, and a number of other texts. (*Clarissa* and *Sir Charles Grandison* were Richardson's two other major novels, published after *Pamela*. *Clarissa*, which resembles *Pamela* in a number of ways, deals with a young bourgeois woman who is imprisoned by Mr. Lovelace, a notorious rake, after fleeing her family. *Grandison* is a novel about a man meant to provide an example of male virtue. *Joseph Andrews* is a novel by Henry Fielding, author of *Shamela*, which features Shamela's brother Joseph and the Booby family. Eliza Haywood's *Anti-Pamela* is a parody of *Pamela* written around the same time as *Shamela*.)

We won't be able to read the majority of these texts during the semester, but Voyant may be able to give us some sense of their contents. Go back to Voyant's main page, upload the zip file, and click Reveal. (You may also want to unzip the file and take a look at its contents.)

Voyant should give you roughly the same windows as before, but this time they'll include analyses of all seven texts in the corpus. Document Terms will show you how word frequencies compare across novels, rather than within parts of *Pamela*. The summary window in the bottom left-hand corner will also give you a comparison of document lengths and a list of "distinctive" words in each document.

The "Scale" menu at the bottom of some of the boxes will let you switch between viewing information about the corpus as a whole and information about individual texts.

Try graphing the frequency of some individual words and combinations of words across the seven texts. What do you notice?

Some questions to consider: how linguistically similar are *Pamela* and the two *Pamela* parodies? What about *Pamela* and Richardson's later works? Does *Pamela* differ from the rest of the corpus in any particularly notable ways? What might this tell us about the relationship(s) among *Pamela* and these other works?

#### Step 6

Challenge: Think about one of the core arguments Nancy Armstrong makes in *Desire and Domestic Fiction*. Is there any way you might - provisionally and partially - use the Voyant tools to extend, press against, or create new evidence for one of these claims? Choose a specific claim or your version of a specific claim, and then think about how you might translate that claim to the level of a word or a collection of words.

Alternate version: do the same thing, but thinking about the larger corpus of texts alongside Michael McKeon's argument in *Generic Transformation and Social Change* about the relationship between Richardson (or naive empiricism) and Fielding (or extreme skepticism).

### Write

Write a paragraph or two on some particularly interesting and suggestive findings from your work in steps 2-6 - the more specific the better. Positive or negative results can be good  findings. Feel free also to share any thoughts about the value and/or difficulty of this type of lightweight text analysis work. Post to Known with #Exercise3 #Voyant #TextAnalysis and any other relevant tags.

### More (optional and for the future)

Voyant just scratches the surface of what we can do with existing text analysis tools and platforms. Two good sources for collections of text analysis platforms and recipes are Alan Liu's [DH Toychest](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital%20Humanities%20Tools#tools-text-analysis) and [Tapor2](http://www.tapor.ca/) - both are large collections of tools for finding, processing, and visualizing texts of different kinds. You may also be interested in taking a look at [the beta version of the new Voyant](http://beta.voyant-tools.org/).

The new (and experimental) [XSEDE](http://ec2-54-85-108-97.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3838/tag/) collection of tools is also interesting; the "data" tab lets you walk through the process of preparing your uploaded text for analysis in a way that teaches you a bit about text preparation. The "explore" tab lets you look at some characteristics of the words in your document, and "transform" offers quick versions of some topic modeling algorithms we will explore in more detail later in the semester.
