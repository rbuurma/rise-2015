# The Preparation of the Text 1: Digital Versions of *Tristram Shandy* (Exercise 4)

Steps 1-5 due by Wednesday, September 30. Step 6 (write-up) due Friday, October 2.

So far, we have looked at and read our eighteenth-century novels in three primary forms: modern printed scholarly editions (or editions based on scholarly editions), digital facsimiles/digital surrogates (images of eighteenth-century editions of some of our novels, usually a few pages at a time), and the Project Gutenberg plain-text versions of our novels (which we have used in our text analysis assignments). This assignment will start us thinking about some of the ways we get from a paper copy of an eighteenth-century novel to a digital facsimile to a plain-text file. It will also help us think about what is at stake in TS's play with typography and images.

Why would we want to convert a digital facsimile into a "plain" text? A digital facsimile is useful in many ways: a series of images of a book (usually one image = one page), it gives us some sense of the look of the book it represents. Usually digital facsimiles are created by creating an image file for each page of a book and then ordering them within a digital framework more or less by their order in the physical book. (We will also want to think, of course, about all of the interesting ways the digital facsimile fails to approximate the physical book; we'll also want to speculate on what some non-mimetic digitization practices might look like.)

However, computers can't recognize the words on a page of a digital image as words; they are legible only as images. If we want machine-readable text, we will have to do something to the images to generate it. One simple but time-consuming way would be for a person to retype the entire text; many early digital texts were in fact made this way. Another option is to use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software to convert image files into text files. As we will see, however, this software isn't perfect. It will generate mistakes - some specific to the particular OCR software we choose, some the result of the interaction between an image of 18th c typography and OCR. Therefore, OCR texts always require some level of correction, whether automated or by hand. (You might also want to note that OCR technology has improved a lot over time - but the OCR of any given work will reflect the state of the technology in the historical moment the text was OCR'd.)

In this assignment, you will locate a digital facsimile of *Tristram Shandy*, OCR and correct a chapter or part of a chapter, and reflect on what you have learned in the process.

*General reminder: create new copies of your text as you modify it. Use informative, standardized file names.*

#### Step 1

Log in to Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO) via Tripod. Find the earliest copy of the first volume of *Tristram Shandy* that you can locate. You will notice that just searching for *Tristram Shandy* as "title" in "basic search" will return lots of hits. Choose "advanced search" and narrow things down (by date, publisher, etc) to get a smaller list of results. (You may need to do a tiny bit of research on the date and publisher of the first volumes of TS to find the appropriate search terms and to make sure you have located an early edition.)

Extra: For a great in-depth overview of the history and contents of ECCO, see the excellent [Beyond Citation](http://www.beyondcitation.org/eighteenth-century-collections-online-ecco/) site. We will use this site more in the future when we go into greater depth with ECCO.

#### Step 2

Take a little time with get familiar with the the first volume of *Tristram Shandy* you have located AND the ECCO interface for this volume. Page through it. Look at the paratexts. Try some keyword searches within it. Do they work? What are you searching when you search for keywords within the text? What does the results list look like?  Can you deliberately make your search fail in some way? (If you have trouble, try for example searching for "Tristram" within the volume.)

Also take a look at the "full citation" and "e-table of contents"  for more information about the volume and work.

#### Step 3

We are going to convert some of these images of pages into machine-readable text. The first thing to do is choose a section of the volume - perhaps a chapter. Decide what section you want to work with, note the image numbers (as opposed to the page numbers), and then click the little brown disk icon in the upper-righthand corner of the screen. (It's meant to look like a floppy disk and to mean "save" - have you ever seen a floppy disk in person?) It will allow you to download your chosen series of pages. Once you have them, rename them something meaningful -  "ShandyV1Ch12_T168420" or something like that.  (T168420 is the English Short Title Catalog number for this work, found in the "full citation" info. You could use something else. The point is to have identifying information so that you know where your digital facsimile came from and could locate the source again in the future.)

Open the resulting PDF. Does a keyword search within it work? Why not, do you think? What happened or didn't happen?

#### Step 4

Now you will OCR your file. You need to find an easy way to use optical character recognition software on that series of page images, which is currently formatted as a PDF. Search around online for a trial version of Abbey FineReader Pro, or Prizmo. You can likely locate a copy of Acrobat Pro on a Swarthmore computer in the ITS Media Lab. Here are [instructions](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/how-to/ocr-software-convert-pdf-to-text.html) for using it. There are a range of other possibilities - any number of free online platforms that will give you different kinds of outputs at wildly varying levels of OCR quality and consistency. Uploading the PDF to Google Drive and then right-clicking to choose "open with Google Docs" will give you an interesting result.

Some OCR tools will give you options for the resulting format - Word document? Plain-text? Ebook? You might want to try a few - this depends on your use, and right now we're just experimenting. (For text analysis purposes, we will eventually want a plain txt file.)

I recommend trying at least two different ways of OCRing your section of TS.

#### Step 5

Clean your text. Open up your original pdf with the page images of your chapter; open a second window with a fresh copy containing the most accurate OCR result you produced. Compare pages. What kinds of mistakes do you see? Identify and correct at least a few pages of mistakes.

#### Step 6 - two paragraphs

Write a paragraph or so about the process. What kinds of mistakes did you notice in the OCR programs? Might there be some way or ways of automatically solving some of them (rather than hand-correcting them as you did)? Aside from obvious mistakes, what else is lost in the "conversion" from image to machine-readable text? (What is at stake in thinking about this as a conversation? What model of the text does that imply? How else might we think about it?) And, by the way, what have you learned about access to and search in digital facsimiles?

Then write a paragraph opening out into one or more of the many large questions raised by this assignment - about the difference between a single copy of a book, a digital facsimile of that book, what that digital facsimile comes to stand for or stand in for in a database like ECCO, and then what happens when we extract a text from that digital facsimile. What questions would you add? How might we begin to answer them? Stay specific - choose one or two.

Post these paragraphs to Known with #Exercise4 #DigitalSurrogates #TextPreparation and any other relevant tags.
