# Evelina in 1778 (Exercise 5)

Writeup due to Known before class Wednesday, October 21, 2015

Estimated time: 2-3 hours

So far in these exercises we have searched, graphed, mapped, and OCR'd individual novels. In this assignment, we will expand our view to look at three new configurations - a set of 100+ printed bibliographic descriptions of novels contemporary with *Evelina*,  a few facsimile copies of novels published in the same year as *Evelina*, and finally all of the plain OCR'd texts of novels we can find in ECCO printed within a chosen 18th-century timeframe via a simple (and, you will find, limited) interface for analyzing multiple texts in ECCO. The aim of this specific assignment is to provide you with a few methods for gauging the place of Frances Burney's *Evelina* (1778) among the other new novels appearing in the same year. It should also start to give you a sense of what late eighteenth-century books looked like (though do note that we lose some aspects of the book when we use a digitized version - more on this later). The assignment involves examining a digital facsimile of the 1779 edition of *Evelina* alongside copies of five or six other books of your choice published between 1776 and 1779. It also requires you to look at bibliographic entries for a wider range of novels published in between 1776 and 1779.  We will then, more briefly, look at a some tools you can use to search a larger set of 18th c novels in ECCO.

All together, these three views of a corpus or collection of eighteenth-century novels will help us learn more about what new novels were like during the eighteenth century, and especially during the years leading up to and after the publication of *Evelina* (1778).  In addition, working with printed traditional bibliographic descriptions of the kind you will find in James Raven's *The English Novel 1770-1829* will help us think about how we create descriptions and representations of books in their presence in order to prepare for their eventual absence - and about how this practice varies historically depending on changing access to books themselves. It will also prepare you to produce your own traditional and experimental descriptive bibliography of a book of your choice. (Experimental Bibliography assignment to be discussed post-break.) But working with print bibliographies will also get us thinking about what we can learn from the existing digital information about books (or "bibliographic metadata") that we can find in online library catalogs - the subject of exercise 6. And playing with a larger collection of novels from 1778 will get us ready for more in-depth work on a corpus in exercise 7 and 8.


#### Step 1: printed bibliographies

>Bibliography is the discipline that studies texts as recorded forms, and the processes of their transmission, including their production and reception...It also frankly accepts that bibliographers should be concerned to show that forms affect meaning.
>Don McKenzie, "The Book as an Expressive Form," 29

1. Go to McCabe; you need to examine volume I of James Raven's *The English Novel, 1770-1829: a bibliographical survey of prose fiction published in the British Isles* (McCabe Reference PR851 .E52 2000). As its title suggests, it is a bibliography of British fiction known to be published during these years. It goes year by year, and so it will be easy for you to look through the offerings of 1776-9. (Ok, this is what you would do if you were embarking on an independent research project. But because I am merciful, I have digitized the relevant sections of the Garside bibliography and placed them in Dropbox. You're welcome.)

2. Look through the different kinds of titles for fictional works between 1776 and 1779. (First, you will probably want to look for a key to help you read the entries. Hint: there is one, and you want to look at it first. There is also a lot of contextual material and historical background - use as you see fit.) See if you can begin to make sense of the array of possible kinds of book titles out there. Can you organize them into types or categories? What do the full titles tell you about the works? About genre? About audience? Do some seem "new", others more backward-looking? How many of these fictional works seem like "novels"? See what you can infer from the other information provided. What audiences do different works seem aimed at? For example, are there some booksellers who publish a lot of fiction? Who seems to be the most prestigious publisher? Who the least? Given that the average wages of a skilled laborer in these years were between 15 and 20 shillings per week, how much do these books cost in relative terms? These are the types of questions I want you to start asking; formulate your own questions based on your own interests.

3. Write a paragraph or two about what you can learn about the novel in 1778 from the bibliography alone. What kinds of questions can you use this information alone to ask and answer?

Optional: after finishing your paragraph, you may be interested in taking a look at Franco Moretti's take on what we can learn from bibliographies of 18th novels; see Dropbox for his article ["Style, Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles (British Novels, 1740-1850)"](http://emc.english.ucsb.edu/emc-courses/novel-mediation-s2011/novel-mediation/articles/moretti.style.pdf).


#### Step 2: digital facsimiles

>Let us leave it to the Reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let us not desert one another; we are an injured body.
>Jane Austen, Northanger Abbey, 59.

1. Once you've looked through the bibliography, go to the Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO) database.  Find the earliest edition possible of *Evelina* (you’ll see it is actually the 1779 edition) and take a careful look at it. Then do searches for some of the titles you noted as being of particular interest from the bibliography. Choose 4-5 novels in addition to Evelina. Have a look at these chosen books. For example, read the prefatory material, look at the frontispieces and illustrations, and even skim a few chapters. Compare these books to *Evelina*. Then think about questions like these:

2. What can we learn from such a comparison between Burney's fiction and other new works published in the same months? What can we learn, as well, from the books (as actual physical objects, or at least as digital representations of physical objects) themselves? Are the novels printed differently or presented in a manner other than what you expected? How many volumes are they? How are they laid out? How is type used?

3. Drawing on our class discussions about title pages and prefaces, think about the role of title pages and prefaces in the novels you're examining. Do the prefaces claim (or disclaim) that the book is a "novel"? How do they talk about authorship? Which novels are anonymous? How is authorship indicated? Is authorship indicated one way on the title page and another way in the preface or introduction? What do you make of this?

4. Think about how the books are titled. Do books that call themselves "historical novels" begin differently from those that have subtitles like "taken from facts" or "a romance"? Based on your examination, what kind of novel is Burney writing? While Burney herself mentions more "classic," earlier 18th c novels and novelists (like Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett), she was also intensely aware of the novels and novelists contemporary to her. Look hard at the subtitles of other books; where does Burney's work fit into the market? What kinds of topics do the novels' titles and contents indicate? How might these relate to Evelina? Where does Burney's novel appear to stand in the hierarchy of prestige and taste? Do Burney's novels appear to have pretensions to elegance or status? How about her choices of title, or the price of the book?

5. Add your own questions.

6. Write another paragraph or two for Known about the most interesting things you have found and tentative conclusions you might draw from your work in this section.


#### Step 3: ARTEMIS

This very brief last step asks you to look at a few simple built-in text analysis tools for a the ECCO corpus, in order to think about what you can learn from them and what you can't.

1. The first thing we must do is select the relevant subsection of the ECCO corpus to work on. Go to the ECCO main page and click on the orange ARTEMIS box in the upper-righthand corner. Go to "advanced search," leave the search box blank, select only the ECCO database, and narrow by the time period of your choice (1700-1800? 1750-1800? 1770-1800?). On the results page, narrow the lefthand "subject" facet to "English fiction." (Hey, how does ARTEMIS know what documents are "English fiction"? Good question! Ideas?)

2. Under "analyse results," explore "term clusters" (read the explanation for how these are created) and play with "term frequency." What can you learn about the collection of texts you selected in your search through using these two tools? What happens if you change the collection of texts you search for and analyze? And what text with what applied algorithm is generating the "term frequency"?

3. Write a final short paragraph about anything you have discovered using ARTEMIS, and/or the (significant) limits of ARTEMIS for large-scale text analysis.
